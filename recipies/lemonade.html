    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half crosswise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer. Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.
        </li>
        <li>It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel.
        </li>
    </ol>
